      <p>Cornerstone Pets offers free local delivery to the following zip codes: 07030, 07310, 07311, 07307, 07086, 07087 & 07093. If you live outside this delivery area, please contact the store directly to discuss options. We may be able to accommodate your request for a small fee.

        Delivery is FREE on all orders over $35 (before tax). We are happy to deliver smaller orders for a fee of $4.95. Qualified food purchases will be applied to their corresponding frequent buyer program; however, free bags do not count toward the delivery minimum.
        
        All delivery orders for Hoboken must be placed by phone or online by 1:00 PM for same day delivery. Delivery requests received after 1 PM will go out the following day. For our customers in Jersey City, Weehawken, Union City and West New York, please place your order at least one day in advance.Deliveries generally go out between 2-8 pm.
        
        We will make every effort to accommodate your schedule, but due to demand we cannot guarantee a specific delivery time. We request a minimum two-hour window for deliveries.If you have a concierge, please let us know the LATEST you can receive your order (e.g. do you need it by 6 PM to feed the pup his dinner?). If your building does not have a concierge AND you are not able to be home to accept delivery, you may specify a drop off area which you deem safe and secure. You assume responsibility for deliveries left in your specified location. Someone must be home to accept delivery of all frozen food orders.
        
        Please call the store at 201-653-4644 if you prefer to arrange your delivery with one of our staff members.
        
        Shipping on most of our products is available through USPS and does not require a minimum order.</p>
